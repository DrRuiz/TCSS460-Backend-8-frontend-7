## How to use

Run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

If docker containers are not set up, use the config files
under oldConfigs to create docker containers for the
back-end using the command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Then use the config files outside of that folder when running
the front-end.

To run the app, execute the command

```bash
npm run dev
```

alongside the docker containers and open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
